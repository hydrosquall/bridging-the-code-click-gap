pyenv activate jupyter-3-9-10
pip install jupyterlab pandas keplergl geopandas mitosheet

## Acknowledgements

- Many of the demos in this repository are built on the work of non-commercial open source projects, in particular
  - The Jupyter / PyData (computational notebooks)
  - The Vega organization (data visualization)
  - Datasette (data sharing)
  - Kepler.gl (geospatial)

The `code-click` terminology was coined by Naomi B. Robbins while workshopping a title for this presentation.
